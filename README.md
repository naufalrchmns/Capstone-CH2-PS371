## Project Backgroud
Addressing the global challenge of improper waste disposal, our team has developed an Android application that leverages Machine Learning to accurately classify trash images and guide users towards responsible disposal practices. Motivated by the environmental and health implications of mismanaged waste, we aim to bridge the knowledge gap through this user-friendly app.

What weâ€™ve done for each of the Learning Paths:

1. Machine Learning: We curated and analyzed relevant datasets to train our Machine Learning model. We selected and optimized algorithms, integrated the model into the mobile app, and conducted rigorous testing.
2. Mobile Development: We designed a user-friendly interface, deployed the model onto the app, and performed thorough testing.
3. Cloud Computing:  We established and configured cloud infrastructure to support app functionality and model deployment.
