## üìù About Dataset
### Waste Classification Dataset Overview

### Problem Statement
Waste management poses a significant challenge in our country, leading to various environmental issues such as increased landfills, eutrophication, consumption of toxic waste by animals, leachate, and a rise in toxins, causing land, water, and air pollution.

### Approach
To address this challenge, a comprehensive approach was taken, including:

1. **Literature Review:**
   - Studied white papers on waste management to understand existing solutions and challenges.

2. **Waste Analysis:**
   - Analyzed the components of household waste to identify key categories.

3. **Waste Segregation:**
   - Segregated waste into two primary classes: Organic and Recyclable.

4. **Automation:**
   - Implemented automation using Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning to streamline the waste classification process.

5. **Toxic Waste Reduction:**
   - Aimed to reduce the disposal of toxic waste in landfills through efficient classification.

### Implementation Details
The dataset is divided into training data (85%) and test data (15%):

- **Training Data:** 22,564 images
- **Test Data:** 2,513 images

### Technologies Used
- **IoT:** Leveraged Internet of Things for real-time data collection and monitoring.
- **Machine Learning:** Implemented machine learning algorithms for automated waste classification.

### Objectives
The primary objectives of this waste classification project are:
1. **Efficient Waste Management:**
   - Enhance waste management processes through accurate classification.
2. **Environmental Preservation:**
   - Mitigate environmental issues by reducing the volume of toxic waste in landfills.
3. **Automation for Scalability:**
   - Achieve scalability and efficiency through the automation of waste classification.

This initiative not only addresses immediate waste management concerns but also contributes to the long-term goal of building sustainable and environmentally friendly practices.
